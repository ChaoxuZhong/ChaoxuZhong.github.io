Recently, I felt a strong urge to find a place to write down my thoughts, primarily to enhance my learning process
through active output. Output compels input, and I refuse to settle for a superficial understanding. I remember setting
up a blog years ago but never actually using it. Today, I realized it has been five years since then.

Just two days after celebrating my 30th birthday, a recurring thought haunts me: "You have achieved nothing." Time has
flown by—it has already been five years since I first set up my blog, and I often wonder, "Where has all the time gone?"

There's another voice in my head, one that contrasts sharply with my own. It belongs to someone I saw on YouTube who,
after earning their Ph.D. at 30, chose to spend two years doing volunteer work.

I was shocked when I compared myself to him. I've always prioritized making money because the lack of savings truly
panics me, making me feel trapped. I marveled at his lack of scarcity and his inner contentment. Meanwhile, I am on a
quest to discover my own inner motivations and follow them, even though I don't fully understand why I often lament, "
You have achieved nothing." These thoughts emerge whenever I feel pressured by time, like on my 30th birthday or when I
realize it's been five years since my blog was active. When I analyze this feeling of unachievement, I realize I don't
wholly embrace what 'achievement' typically means; hence, I am conflicted and suspect I might be deceiving myself.

In summary, I need words, I need to document thoughts, as a suspect needs evidence. Most of all, I need to relax—just
relax, leave a few traces.

  I had celebrated my 30 years old birthday two days ago, so there always flash some voice said   "your are not success" in my mind. at the same time , the time from the first time I build my blog to now already 5 years, I always thinging "where the time goes?".
  </p>
  <p>
    Ofcourse there is another voice fight in my mind,is a preson go to do 义工 for two years after he get his 博士 degree.
  </p>
  <p>Compareing myself with this man , I was shocked. Because I always think earn money is the most priority thing, no money exist in my hand alwalys makes me anxious and pandamic, It seems like I have nowhere to runaway. I was shocked because he is not kuifa,and is a filled with person. At the sametime, I always to find out my inner motivation, and follow them, because I even don't know why I always think about "I haven't successed in nothing", they just pop out when I feel the time is not enough just like my 30 year old's birthday or turn out that I haven't wirte any blog since I built it 5 years ago.when I anaylis this voice, I am not agree with those "success", so I am ningba, I am suspect in cheating myself. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Summary,I need the word write down, I need some record just like the suspect need evidence. Surely yes, what I most needed is easy on me , just easy ,just relax and leave some zhusimaji.
